"""
Extensive-form games assignments.

Starting this week, the templates will no longer contain exact function
signatures and there will not be any automated tests like we had for the
normal-form games assignments. Instead, we will provide sample outputs
produced by the reference implementations which you can use to verify
your solutions. The reason for this change is that there are many valid
ways to represent game trees (e.g. flat array-based vs. pointer-based),
information sets and strategies in extensive-form games. Figuring out
the most suitable representations is an important part of assignments
in this block. Unfortunately, this freedom makes automated testing
pretty much impossible.
